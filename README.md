Introduction
------------

The [Seeding the Commons @ UQ](http://www.itee.uq.edu.au/eresearch/projects/ands/stc) developed and deployed [DataSpace](http://dataspace.uq.edu.au/), a registry of University of Queensland's research data assets.

The registry supports creation, storage and management of metadata records describing UQ research data holdings, the researchers and projects that created the data, and any online services that allow access or manipulation of the data.

The registry syndicates these descriptions to the ANDS [Research Data Australia](http://researchdata.ands.org.au/) service, allowing national promotion and discovery of UQ research data holdings.
